# Darwin: The Evolution of Document Interaction

Darwin represents the next leap in document-based communication, offering a unique platform where users can upload documents and engage in insightful conversations with them. At its heart, Darwin harnesses the power of text embedding and the Pinecone vector database to understand and contextualize document content. This innovative approach allows for a more nuanced and interactive experience, as users explore and query their documents in a conversational manner. By integrating LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models, including the sophisticated GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4-1106-preview, Darwin delivers a groundbreaking way to interact with text, revolutionizing how we comprehend and engage with information.

## Running the Project

To embark on this journey, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. With these tools ready, initiate the application with the following incantation in the project's root sanctum:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This mystical command conjures up all the services detailed in the docker-compose.yml grimoire. The application then materializes at `localhost:8000` (or the port you've predestined in the docker-compose.yml scroll).
